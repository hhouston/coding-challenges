Fragments-Challenge
===================

Create a small app with the following characteristics:

With the device in the portrait mode, display a fragment with a single EditText instructing the user to enter his or her name.  Below that, display five buttons labelled "Button 1", "Button 2", "Button 3", "Button 4" "Button 5".
 Tapping any of those buttons will swap in a new fragment with a simple text field displaying the message, "Hello <name>!  You tapped Button 1" (or 2, and so on).  Tapping the back button returns to the original fragment with the five buttons.

 When the device is in the landscape mode, display the two fragment side-by-side within the same activity, but keep the behavior described above (except that the back button will exit the app as there is no fragment to go back to.)

 [Feel free to use either the Fragment call introduced in API level 11 (android.app.Fragment) or the Fragment class found in the Android support library (android.support.v4.app.Fragment).]
