Almost Sorted Intervals - HackerRank
------------------------------------
Given a sequence of numbers, how many "almost sorted intervals" (first number is lowest and last number is highest, but
the middle can be in any order) can be found?

Anagram
-------
Given a string, determine if it is an anagram or not.

Basic Cryptanalysis - HackerRank
--------------------------------
Given a dictionary and some ciphertext encoded using a substitution cipher, find the corresponding plaintext.

Binary Complement (for Clear Channel) - HackerRank
----------------------------------------------
Given an integer, compute its binary complement, then return the complement as an integer.

FizzBuzz (for Clear Channel) - HackerRank
-------------------------------------
The classic.  For integers 1 to N, if n is divisible by 3 print "Fizz", if it's divisible by 5 print "Buzz", and if it's
divisible by both print "FizzBuzz".

FizzBuzz - CodeEval
-------------------
A slight variation on the classic-- instead of factors of 3 and 5, the factors are provided at runtime.

Love Letter - HackerRank
------------------------
Given a string, what are the minimum number of "stepping down" opeations (changing a letter to the one before it in
the alphabet) needed to make the string an anagram?

Triangle Pass - CodeEval
------------------------
Given an input file that has one integer on the first line, two on the second line, three on the third, and so
forth, in the shape of a triangle, traverse down the lines starting with the first number then down to an adjacent lower
number (one position to the left left or right) and keep a running sum as you go.  What is the maximum sum that can be
found for a path down the triangle?

Utopia Tree
-----------
Given a tree that grows 1 meter in the Spring and double in the fall, how tall is it after N growth cycles?

Valid Braces
------------
Given a string of braces (curly, square, and parenthesis), validate that the braces are properly nested according to type.
