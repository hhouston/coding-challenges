Coding Challenges
=================
The following coding challenges were done either for fun, or as part of a job interview.  If done for an interview,
the company's name is in parentheses.  If done on a public-facing coding challenge website, the website is listed after
the hyphen.

Almost Sorted Intervals - HackerRank
------------------------------------
Given a sequence of numbers, how many "almost sorted intervals" (first number is lowest and last number is highest, but
the middle can be in any order) can be found?

Anagram (for Hired)
-------------------
Given a string, determine if it is an anagram.

Basic Cryptanalysis - HackerRank
--------------------------------
Given a dictionary and some ciphertext encoded using a substitution cipher, find the corresponding plaintext.

Binary Complement (for Clear Channel) - HackerRank
----------------------------------------------
Given an integer, compute its binary complement, then return the complement as an integer.

FizzBuzz (for Clear Channel) - HackerRank
-------------------------------------
The classic.  For integers 1 to N, if n is divisible by 3 print "Fizz", if it's divisible by 5 print "Buzz", and if it's
divisible by both print "FizzBuzz".

FizzBuzz - CodeEval
-------------------
A slight variation on the classic-- instead of factors of 3 and 5, the factors are provided at runtime.

Fragments (for City Maps)
-------------------------
Create an app that when in portrait mode has two activities, each with its own fragment, but when in landscape mode
has the two fragments in a single activity.

Love Letter - HackerRank
------------------------
Given a string, what are the minimum number of "stepping down" operations (changing a letter to the one before it in
the alphabet) needed to make the string an anagram?

Triangle Pass - CodeEval
------------------------
Given an input file that has one integer on the first line, two on the second line, three on the third, and so
forth, in the shape of a triangle, traverse down the lines starting with the first number then down to an adjacent lower
number (one position to the left left or right) and keep a running sum as you go.  What is the maximum sum that can be
found for a path down the triangle?

Utopia Tree - HackerRank
-----------------------
Given a tree that grows 1 meter in the spring and double in the fall, how tall is it after N growth cycles?

Valid Braces (for Hired)
------------------------
Given a string of braces (curly, square, and parenthesis), validate that the braces are properly nested according to type.
